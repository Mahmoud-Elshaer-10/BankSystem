apply filter functionality for Transactions

centralize dgvAccounts_CellFormatting in MyDataGridView

noticed bug:
toolTip weird behaviour. like when opening ClientAccountsForm then pressing escape key (does not happen if click close button using the mouse), toolTip appears with a client name of the current selected.

consider fetching only necessary data on initial load (paginated API calls).



====================================================================================
Write unit tests for ClientRepository.cs or API endpoints to show TDD skills.

Package the app for distribution (e.g., installer)

Demo Script

document the app in a GitHub README for recruiters.
