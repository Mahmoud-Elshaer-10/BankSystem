I get some warnings after build
CS8625 Cannot convert null literal to non-nullable reference type.
CS8618 Non-nullable property 'FullName' must contain a non-null value when exiting constructor. Consider adding the 'required' modifier or declaring the property as nullable.
CS8601 Possible null reference assignment.


Grid Column Formatting:
Idea: Format dgvClients, dgvAccounts columns (e.g., Balance as $123.45, ClientID fixed width).


Duplicate Check:
Idea: Check for duplicate Email (in ClientForm) or ClientID (in AccountForm) via API before saving.




more polish?
