Interview Explanation:

Question: “How did you resolve unexpected resizing in your WinForms app?”
Answer: “I found that setting the DataGridView’s width before the form’s width caused anchoring to increase the grid’s width by the form’s width increment. By setting the form’s width first and the DataGridView’s width last, I overrode the anchoring adjustment, ensuring correct sizing with a single method call.”
