initialize git


always on top 
create one method like FilterFunctionality and make it call the other two methods
make user control for filter for easy reusability
I added some padding to buttons to make sure icons are not clipped (shall we create custom control for button like we did for datagrid view)
stop escape button in main form from closing
validating using errorprovider for example instead of messagebox
a way to make every form a child of main form (this.MdiParent = MainForm)
if user control can be used
delegate to send data back to form
define event to use from user control
more polish?


Currently stoped at this in chat:
yes functionality works fine. please also provide the code for AccountListForm.
