check TransactionForm logic
====================================================================================

I noticed a bug in winforms:
toolTip has a weird behaviour. like when opening ClientAccountsForm then pressing escape key (does not happen if click close button using the mouse), toolTip appears with a client name of the current selected.

Write unit tests for ClientRepository.cs or API endpoints to show TDD skills.

Package the app for distribution (e.g., installer)

Demo Script

document the app in a GitHub README for recruiters.
